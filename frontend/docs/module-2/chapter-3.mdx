## Introduction

Simulating sensors is a crucial aspect of robotics development. Different sensors provide different types of data that robots use to understand their environment and navigate.

## Sensor Types

### LiDAR
LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) sensors provide accurate 3D mapping of the environment.

### Depth Cameras
Depth cameras provide information about the distance to objects in the scene.

### IMUs
IMUs (Inertial Measurement Units) measure acceleration and rotation.

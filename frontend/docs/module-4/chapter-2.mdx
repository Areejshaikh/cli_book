# Cognitive Planning: LLMs convert natural language to ROS 2 actions

## Learning Objectives
- Understand cognitive planning in robotics
- Learn how LLMs process natural language commands
- Implement LLM-to-ROS action conversion

## Introduction

Cognitive planning involves using Large Language Models (LLMs) to convert natural language commands into specific robotic actions. This enables robots to understand and execute complex instructions given in human language.

## LLM Integration

LLMs can be integrated with ROS 2 to interpret natural language commands and convert them into appropriate ROS 2 actions and behaviors.



## Summary
- LLMs enable natural language understanding
- Cognitive planning converts language to actions
- Integration with ROS 2 enables robotic execution

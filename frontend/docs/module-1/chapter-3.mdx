# URDF: Unified Robot Description Format for humanoids

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the purpose of URDF in robotics
- Learn how to describe humanoid robots using URDF
- Explore the structure and elements of URDF files

## Introduction

URDF (Unified Robot Description Format) is an XML-based format used to describe robot models in ROS. It defines the physical and visual properties of a robot, including its joints, links, and kinematic relationships.

## URDF for Humanoid Robots

When describing humanoid robots in URDF, special attention must be paid to:

- Joint limits and safety constraints
- Balance and center of mass considerations
- Kinematic chains for arms and legs
- Sensor placement for perception


## Summary
- URDF is essential for robot simulation and control
- Humanoid robots require special kinematic considerations
- Proper URDF enables accurate simulation

## Quiz
1. What does URDF stand for?
   - a) Unified Robot Definition Format
   - b) Universal Robot Description Framework
   - c) Unified Robot Description Format

2. What aspects of a robot does URDF define?
   - a) Only visual properties
   - b) Only kinematic properties
   - c) Physical, visual, and kinematic properties

3. Why are joint limits important in humanoid URDF?
   - a) For simulation accuracy
   - b) For safety and realistic movement
   - c) For rendering purposes

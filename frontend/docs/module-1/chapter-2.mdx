# Python agents using rclpy to control ROS

## Learning Objectives
- Learn how to create Python agents that interact with ROS
- Understand how to use rclpy to control ROS from Python
- Implement basic robot control using Python agents

## Introduction

Python agents using rclpy provide a powerful way to control ROS (Robot Operating System) systems. The rclpy library is the Python client library for ROS 2, enabling Python programs to interact with the ROS 2 ecosystem.

## Creating a Python Agent

To create a Python agent that controls ROS, you'll need to:

1. Import the rclpy library
2. Initialize the ROS client
3. Create nodes, publishers, and subscribers
4. Implement control logic
5. Handle cleanup


## Summary
- rclpy is the Python client library for ROS 2
- Python agents can control ROS systems effectively
- Proper initialization and cleanup are important

## Quiz
1. What does rclpy stand for?
   - a) Robot Control Library for Python
   - b) ROS Client Library for Python
   - c) Robot Communication Layer for Python

2. What is required to create a Python agent for ROS?
   - a) Only the rclpy library
   - b) rclpy library and ROS 2 installation
   - c) rclpy library, ROS 2, and specific robot drivers

3. Why is proper cleanup important in Python agents?
   - a) To save memory
   - b) To properly release ROS resources
   - c) To improve performance

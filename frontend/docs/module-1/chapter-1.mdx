# ROS 2 Nodes, Topics, and Services

## Learning Objectives
- Understand the fundamental concepts of ROS 2 architecture
- Learn how to implement basic nodes
- Explore communication patterns using topics and services

## Introduction

ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2) provides a flexible framework for writing robot software. It's a collection of tools, libraries, and conventions that aim to simplify the task of creating complex and robust robot behavior across a wide variety of robot platforms.

## Core Concepts

### Nodes
A node is a process that performs computation. ROS 2 applications are composed of multiple nodes that work together to accomplish complex tasks. Nodes are typically organized to keep the system modular and maintainable.

### Topics and Publishers/Subscribers
Topics enable asynchronous communication between nodes using a publish/subscribe model. A node publishes messages to a topic, and other nodes subscribe to that topic to receive the messages.

### Services
Services provide synchronous request/response communication between nodes. A client sends a request to a service, and the service returns a response.


## Summary
- Nodes are the basic execution units in ROS 2
- Topics enable asynchronous communication via publish/subscribe
- Services provide synchronous request/response communication
